        <h2>Core Values</h2>
<p>My primary values are that learning never stops and to strive for excellence in all things. I believe in the benefits of competition and collaboration, and that patience and open-mindedness are essential to finding the best solution to any challenge. I also treasure being a father to my daughter and husband to my wife. There's nothing better than taking good care of your loved ones, and helping them grow into their best selves.</p>

        <h2> Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to play guitar and record music! I've been in several bands over the years, many of which I was the primary songwriter and bandleader. I also love the outdoors. I love hiking, and it is a dream of mine to hike and camp in as many national parks as I can. My wife and I love to travel and hope to vacation in europe sometime in the next few years.</p>
